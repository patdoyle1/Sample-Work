This assignment using C++ dynamic memory to create a median filter, as well as the ability to rotate an image, and create the negative of the image. The results from these files are "negative.pgm" for the negative of the image. "output.pgm" for the median filter of pt(0-8).pgm and then rotatepepper.pgm for the rotated image of the pepper.pgm. 


To run this there is a makefile provided.
Median Filter -- ./imagestack file1.pgm file2.pgm... youroutputfile.pgm

rotage image -- ./image filetorotate.pgm youroutputfile.pgm

negative image -- ./image filetonegative.pgm youroutputfile.pgm

There are no memory leaks through valgrind however a couple of errors are thrown with accessing instantiated memory. This can be fixed by initializing the whole array (i.e to 0) before you do anything with it.
